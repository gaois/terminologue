# About *Terminologue*

## Terminologue

*Terminologue* is an open-source terminology management tool. The software is developed and maintained by the [Gaois research group](https://www.gaois.ie/en/) in [Fiontar & Scoil na Gaeilge](https://www.dcu.ie/fiontar_scoilnagaeilge/gaeilge/index.shtml), [Dublin City University](https://www.dcu.ie/). The software is copyright of [Dublin City University](https://www.dcu.ie/) and is available under the open-source [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). The lead developer is [Michal Boleslav Měchura](https://michmech.github.io/). Download the software from [here](https://github.com/gaois/terminologue) if you wish to install your own instance of *Terminologue*.

## Terminologue.org

*[Terminologue.org](https://www.terminologue.org/)* is a cloud-based instance of the *Terminologue* software. This instance is hosted by the [Gaois research group](https://www.gaois.ie/en/) (Dublin City University). If you do not wish to install your own instance of the software, you can start writing and publishing termbases by [creating an account](/signup/) on *Terminologue.org*. While we will make every attempt to keep your termbases safe, we cannot guarantee this. Instead, we ask that you periodically export and backup your own termbases.

## Téarma

The *Terminologue* software was originally developed by Fiontar & Scoil na Gaeilge for [Foras na Gaeilge](https://www.forasnagaeilge.ie/) to manage *Téarma*, the National Terminology Database for Irish ([téarma.ie](https://www.tearma.ie/)). The *Téarma* termbase contains *c.*186,000 entries, managed in a dedicated private instance of *Terminologue*.

## Data protection information

We do not collect any usage data. When you sign up for an account on *Terminologue.org*, you supply us with an email address and a password. We will not share your email address with anyone, but we reserve the right to contact you occasionally with regard to the *Terminologue.org* service. Your password is sent over a secure connection and hashed before being saved to the database. This means that no one has access to your password, not even us. You can configure your termbases to be public or private.
